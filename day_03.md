**Title:** Grace for Today

**Scripture:** Lamentations 3:23 – 'They are new every morning; great is your faithfulness.'

**Devotion:**
You don’t have to borrow grace for tomorrow. God gives just what you need for *today*. His mercy resets each sunrise. Don’t try to carry next week’s weight with today’s portion.

**Action Step:** Breathe deep. Say, “There is grace for *this* moment.” Trust that it’s true.

**Prayer:**
Lord, I receive Your new mercy today. I don’t need to fear the future when You’re already there.
