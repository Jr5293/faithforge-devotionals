**Title:** Let the Light In

**Scripture:** John 8:12 – 'I am the light of the world. Whoever follows me... will have the light of life.'

**Devotion:**
Darkness hides in shame, fear, and lies. Jesus brings light—truth, hope, healing. You don’t have to fear what light exposes. It’s how freedom begins.

**Action Step:** Open up to someone you trust about something you’ve kept hidden.

**Prayer:**
Jesus, shine Your light into every part of me. Let nothing stay in darkness.
