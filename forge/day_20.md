**Title:** Show Up Every Day

**Scripture:** Galatians 6:9 – 'Let us not grow weary in doing good...'

**Devotion:**
Greatness is not built in one big moment—it’s built daily. Every day you show up, every time you stay faithful, every time you choose right—it counts. Real men don’t quit. They commit.

**Action Step:** Choose one area where you’ve been inconsistent. Show up again today.

**Prayer:**
Father, help me be the man who shows up, every day, no matter what.
