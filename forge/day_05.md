**Title:** Built to Endure

**Scripture:** James 1:12 – 'Blessed is the man who remains steadfast under trial...'

**Devotion:**
Culture teaches men to chase success fast. But God builds slowly—with intention. Like stone laid on stone. Endurance is strength under pressure over time. Hold the line. Finish the race.

**Action Step:** List three commitments God has called you to remain faithful in. Recommit today.

**Prayer:**
God, help me run with endurance. Strengthen my resolve to remain faithful.
