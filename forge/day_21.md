**Title:** Eyes on Eternity

**Scripture:** Colossians 3:2 – 'Set your minds on things above, not on earthly things.'

**Devotion:**
A man who lives only for today will fall in temptation tomorrow. Eternal vision builds eternal character. Fix your eyes beyond your bank account, beyond applause, beyond pain. Keep heaven in your scope.

**Action Step:** Write one thing you’re focusing too much on. Shift your focus to eternity today.

**Prayer:**
Lord, lift my eyes above distractions. Help me see with eternal perspective.
