**Title:** Discipline Over Desire

**Scripture:** Hebrews 12:11 – 'No discipline seems pleasant at the time, but painful...'

**Devotion:**
Men who succeed spiritually, financially, or physically all share one trait: discipline. Your desires lie. Discipline tells the truth. Choose to train, not coast. Discipline leads to legacy.

**Action Step:** Set a 3-day goal in prayer, physical fitness, or fasting—and keep it.

**Prayer:**
Lord, help me choose what I want most over what I want now.
