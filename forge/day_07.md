**Title:** Carry the Weight

**Scripture:** Galatians 6:2 – 'Carry each other’s burdens, and in this way you will fulfill the law of Christ.'

**Devotion:**
A real man doesn’t just carry his own load—he helps lift others. Strength is meant to serve. Your brother is struggling? Don’t ignore it. Carrying burdens together builds brotherhood and multiplies endurance.

**Action Step:** Reach out to a friend or brother in Christ and ask how you can support him today.

**Prayer:**
Jesus, show me whose burdens I can help carry—and give me the heart to lift them.
