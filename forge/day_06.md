**Title:** Silent Strength

**Scripture:** Psalm 46:10 – 'Be still, and know that I am God.'

**Devotion:**
Real strength doesn’t always roar. Sometimes, it stands silent in trust. The world trains men to always act, speak, push—but God teaches restraint, stillness, and surrender. Stillness is not weakness—it’s weaponized faith.

**Action Step:** Spend 10 minutes in complete stillness. No music. No scrolling. Just listen to God.

**Prayer:**
Lord, teach me to find strength in stillness and peace in Your presence.
