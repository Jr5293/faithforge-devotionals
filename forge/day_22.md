**Title:** The Power of a Yes

**Scripture:** Matthew 5:37 – 'Let your 'Yes' be yes, and your 'No,' no.'

**Devotion:**
Integrity isn’t in your words—it’s in your consistency. Men of God follow through. One honest “yes” followed by action is more powerful than a thousand empty promises. Your yes should carry weight.

**Action Step:** Follow through on something you said you’d do—even if it’s inconvenient.

**Prayer:**
God, teach me to honor my word the way You honor Yours.
