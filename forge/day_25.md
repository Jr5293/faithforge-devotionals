**Title:** Grace is Not Weakness

**Scripture:** 2 Corinthians 12:9 – 'But he said to me, 'My grace is sufficient for you...''

**Devotion:**
Grace is not soft. It’s steel wrapped in mercy. Grace carries you when guilt wants to crush you. Don’t mistake God’s grace for permission to stay stuck. It’s power to get back up.

**Action Step:** Receive God’s grace today. Let go of what He’s already forgiven.

**Prayer:**
Father, thank You for grace. Teach me to walk in it boldly and extend it freely.
