**Title:** Confess and Conquer

**Scripture:** James 5:16 – 'Confess your sins to one another... that you may be healed.'

**Devotion:**
Secrecy is the soil where sin grows. Confession kills it. Real men don’t hide—they heal. Freedom comes not just from repentance to God, but confession to a brother. You don’t need to fake strength.

**Action Step:** Confess one struggle to a trusted godly man today. Don’t wait.

**Prayer:**
Lord, give me the courage to confess, and the humility to receive healing.
