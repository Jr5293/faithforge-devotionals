**Title:** Be the Man in the Mirror

**Scripture:** 2 Corinthians 13:5 – 'Examine yourselves to see whether you are in the faith.'

**Devotion:**
You can fool the crowd but not the mirror. A man of God examines his heart, his motives, and his walk. Integrity starts when you choose truth over image. Don’t pose—pursue.

**Action Step:** Ask yourself: “Is the man in the mirror fully surrendered?” Adjust accordingly.

**Prayer:**
Lord, show me the truth about myself, and give me the strength to grow from it.
