**Title:** Speak Life

**Scripture:** Proverbs 18:21 – 'Death and life are in the power of the tongue...'

**Devotion:**
Men shape the world around them by what they speak. Words can wound or heal, build or break. Choose to speak life—to your family, your friends, and yourself. Life-giving men change atmospheres.

**Action Step:** Speak an intentional word of life over someone today—encouragement, truth, or affirmation.

**Prayer:**
Lord, bridle my tongue. Let my words build, heal, and point others to You.
