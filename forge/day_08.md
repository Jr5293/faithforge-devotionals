**Title:** A Man Under Authority

**Scripture:** Matthew 8:9 – 'For I too am a man under authority...'

**Devotion:**
The Roman centurion understood something many men miss: true authority flows from submission. Before you lead, you must learn to follow. Honor God’s order. Stay under God’s covering. Your strength grows in obedience.

**Action Step:** Identify one area where you’ve resisted godly authority—then submit it today.

**Prayer:**
God, make me a man under Your authority, not my own pride.
