**Title:** Strength in Surrender

**Scripture:** 2 Corinthians 12:9 – 'My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness.'

**Devotion:**
God’s strength is not for the proud. It flows through surrender. As men, we often want to power through on our own—but divine strength begins when human strength ends. Surrender isn’t quitting. It’s trusting.

**Action Step:** Admit one area where you’ve been trying to handle it all alone. Surrender it in prayer.

**Prayer:**
Lord, I lay down my pride. Be strong where I am weak.
