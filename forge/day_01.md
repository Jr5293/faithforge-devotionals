# Forge

**Title:** The Anvil of Trials

**Scripture:** James 1:2 – 'Consider it pure joy, my brothers, whenever you face trials of many kinds...'

**Devotion:**
A blacksmith’s work is done on the anvil. It’s loud, hot, and hard—but it's where shape is given. Likewise, God uses trials to shape men. Not to break us, but to forge us. Your pain is not pointless; it's preparation.

**Action Step:** Reflect on a past trial. What strength or skill did it forge in you?

**Prayer:**
God, help me embrace the trials You allow, knowing You are shaping me for purpose.
