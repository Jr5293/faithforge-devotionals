**Title:** Integrity in the Shadows

**Scripture:** Proverbs 10:9 – 'Whoever walks in integrity walks securely...'

**Devotion:**
True strength shows when no one is watching. Integrity is choosing what’s right in private, not just public. You don’t need applause to do what’s right—you need conviction.

**Action Step:** Audit your habits. Remove or replace one that compromises your integrity.

**Prayer:**
Lord, give me the courage to be consistent behind closed doors.
