**Title:** Lead from the Front

**Scripture:** 1 Corinthians 11:1 – 'Follow me, as I follow Christ.'

**Devotion:**
Leadership isn’t about position—it’s about motion. Paul led by example. Jesus washed feet. As a man of God, you lead when you move with purpose, love with strength, and serve without shame.

**Action Step:** Identify one area in your life where you’ve been passive. Take initiative today.

**Prayer:**
Jesus, help me lead with courage, humility, and consistency.
