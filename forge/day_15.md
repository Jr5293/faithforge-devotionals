**Title:** Resist and Stand

**Scripture:** James 4:7 – 'Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.'

**Devotion:**
Temptation isn’t sin—but surrendering to it is. God gives you the power to resist. You are not a slave to sin. Stand your ground. Fight. Freedom is forged through repeated resistance.

**Action Step:** Name the temptation you’ve been facing. Out loud. Then resist it in prayer and truth.

**Prayer:**
Jesus, give me strength to stand and resist. I am not a slave—I am free.
