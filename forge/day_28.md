**Title:** Kingdom Before Comfort

**Scripture:** Matthew 6:33 – 'Seek first the kingdom of God...'

**Devotion:**
Every day you serve something: comfort or the Kingdom. Comfort says, “Take it easy.” Kingdom says, “Take up your cross.” Don’t let ease be your master. Greatness is on the other side of discomfort.

**Action Step:** Choose to do the harder thing today—on purpose.

**Prayer:**
Jesus, I choose Your Kingdom over my comfort. Lead me into obedience, not ease.
