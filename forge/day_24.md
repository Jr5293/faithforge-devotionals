**Title:** Don't Compromise the Standard

**Scripture:** 1 Peter 1:16 – 'Be holy, because I am holy.'

**Devotion:**
The standard isn’t perfection—it’s holiness. That means being set apart. Different. The world calls it “too serious.” God calls it “chosen.” Compromise may feel easier now, but it costs more later.

**Action Step:** Identify one area where you've lowered God's standard—and raise it again.

**Prayer:**
God, help me pursue holiness, not comfort. Make me bold enough to live set apart.
