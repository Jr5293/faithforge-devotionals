**Title:** Fight the Right Battles

**Scripture:** Ephesians 6:12 – 'Our struggle is not against flesh and blood...'

**Devotion:**
Don’t waste your strength on the wrong fights—arguments, ego, revenge. The real battle is spiritual. Behind the conflict is an enemy trying to steal your peace, purpose, and perspective.

**Action Step:** Identify a recent argument. Pray against the spiritual forces behind it.

**Prayer:**
God, help me see the real battle and fight with spiritual weapons, not flesh.
