# Forge

**Title:** Tempered in the Fire

**Scripture:** Isaiah 43:2 – 'When you walk through the fire, you will not be burned...'

**Devotion:**
God doesn't promise we won't face fire—He promises we won't be destroyed by it. Like steel in the forge, we’re made stronger through pressure and flame. Don’t flee the heat. Face it with faith.

**Action Step:** Journal one trial you’re facing today. Ask: “How is God using this to temper me?”

**Prayer:**
Refiner, don’t remove me from the fire—stay with me in it and shape me through it.
