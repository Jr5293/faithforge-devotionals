**Title:** War in the Spirit

**Scripture:** 2 Corinthians 10:4 – 'The weapons we fight with are not the weapons of the world...'

**Devotion:**
You were made for battle, but not every fight is physical. Spiritual warfare is real. The enemy attacks through doubt, distraction, and temptation. Armor up in prayer and scripture. Don’t fight unarmed.

**Action Step:** Read Ephesians 6:10–18. Identify which piece of armor you need to strengthen.

**Prayer:**
Father, train my hands for spiritual battle. Make me a warrior in Your strength.
