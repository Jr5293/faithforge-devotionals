**Title:** Keep Swinging the Hammer

**Scripture:** Galatians 6:9 – 'Let us not become weary in doing good...'

**Devotion:**
The wall isn’t built in one swing—it’s built brick by brick. Some days the hammer feels heavy, but progress is made in the persistence. You may not see it yet—but every faithful swing matters.

**Action Step:** Don’t quit. Stay consistent in one spiritual habit for 7 more days.

**Prayer:**
God, strengthen my hands to keep building. Even when I’m tired, keep me faithful.
