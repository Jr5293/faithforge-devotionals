**Title:** Your Work is Worship

**Scripture:** Colossians 3:23 – 'Whatever you do, work at it with all your heart, as working for the Lord...'

**Devotion:**
Your job isn’t just a paycheck—it’s a pulpit. The way you show up, grind, and lead speaks louder than a sermon. Men of God work with excellence because their real boss is Jesus.

**Action Step:** Ask yourself: “Would I do this the same way if Jesus signed my check?” Then adjust.

**Prayer:**
Jesus, be Lord over my work ethic, my attitude, and my results.
