**Title:** Own the Room with Humility

**Scripture:** James 4:6 – 'God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble.'

**Devotion:**
You don’t have to shout to lead. True presence doesn’t need to dominate—it radiates. Humility is strength under control. Walk into every room with a servant’s heart, not a showman’s pride.

**Action Step:** In your next interaction, choose to listen first and speak last.

**Prayer:**
Lord, let my humility be louder than my ego. Teach me to lead low and love big.
