**Title:** A Builder, Not a Breaker

**Scripture:** 1 Thessalonians 5:11 – 'Encourage one another and build each other up...'

**Devotion:**
A godly man is a builder. He builds homes with love, builds brothers with words, and builds legacy through discipline. You were not made to destroy. You were made to build.

**Action Step:** Encourage a man in your life today—directly, sincerely, intentionally.

**Prayer:**
Make me a builder, Lord. Let my life add strength to others, not take it.
