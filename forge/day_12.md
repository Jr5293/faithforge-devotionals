**Title:** The Company You Keep

**Scripture:** 1 Corinthians 15:33 – 'Do not be misled: ‘Bad company corrupts good character.’'

**Devotion:**
Every man is sharpened—or dulled—by who walks beside him. Brotherhood is powerful. Your future is shaped by your circle. Choose men who push you toward holiness, not just hang out in comfort.

**Action Step:** Evaluate your closest 3 relationships. Do they sharpen or soften your walk?

**Prayer:**
God, surround me with men who challenge and strengthen me in You.
