**Title:** He is Faithful

**Scripture:** Deuteronomy 7:9 – 'Know therefore that the Lord your God is God; he is the faithful God...'

**Devotion:**
When everything else changes, God remains. His promises hold steady in chaos. He’s not faithful because of you—He’s faithful because of who He is. He doesn’t forget what He promised.

**Action Step:** Remember a time God came through for you. Write it down. Tell someone.

**Prayer:**
God, You have never failed me. And You never will. Strengthen my trust in Your faithfulness.
