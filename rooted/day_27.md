**Title:** The Root of Joy

**Scripture:** Psalm 16:11 – 'In your presence is fullness of joy.'

**Devotion:**
Real joy doesn’t come from circumstances—it comes from presence. When you're close to God, joy flows—even in pressure. Don’t chase happiness. Stay rooted in His presence.

**Action Step:** Spend time in worship today—even if just one song.

**Prayer:**
God, draw me into Your presence. Let joy rise from my roots.
