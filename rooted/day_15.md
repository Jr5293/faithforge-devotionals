**Title:** Obedience Builds Stability

**Scripture:** Matthew 7:24 – 'Everyone who hears these words of mine and puts them into practice is like a wise man who built his house on the rock.'

**Devotion:**
Obedience is how you dig deep. Knowledge is not enough. Hearing without doing is like planting with no water. Stability comes when obedience becomes your default.

**Action Step:** What is one thing God has told you to do that you haven’t yet done? Do it today.

**Prayer:**
Jesus, help me build with obedience, not just understanding.
