**Title:** Rain Grows the Roots

**Scripture:** Matthew 5:45 – 'He sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous.'

**Devotion:**
Rain can feel like trouble, but in God's hands, it’s growth. You don’t always need sunshine—you need whatever will strengthen your roots. Don’t curse the rain. Let it soak in.

**Action Step:** Thank God for one current hardship—then ask what He’s growing through it.

**Prayer:**
Father, I trust You with the rain. Use it to grow me deeper.
