# Rooted

**Title:** Don't Live Uprooted

**Scripture:** Matthew 13:21 – 'They quickly fall away because they have no root.'

**Devotion:**
Without roots, even good people fall away. You weren’t made to live in spiritual survival mode. You were made to abide. Stay planted. Stay nourished. Stay growing.

**Action Step:** Ask God where you’ve grown disconnected—and return today.

**Prayer:**
Lord, plant me again. I want to stay with You, not visit occasionally.
