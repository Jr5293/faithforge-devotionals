# Rooted

**Title:** Stay Rooted in Community

**Scripture:** Acts 2:42 – 'They devoted themselves to... fellowship...'

**Devotion:**
Roots are stronger when intertwined. You weren’t created for isolation. Community isn’t perfect, but it’s necessary. It strengthens, corrects, and encourages. Don’t walk alone.

**Action Step:** Reach out to someone and pray for them—or with them—today.

**Prayer:**
Lord, help me plant deep in the soil of godly community.
