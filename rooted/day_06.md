**Title:** Steady in the Storm

**Scripture:** Matthew 7:25 – 'Though the winds blow... it did not fall, because it had its foundation on the rock.'

**Devotion:**
Life will shake you, but God will steady you. When your foundation is built on Christ, you don’t have to fear the storm. You might bend—but you won’t break.

**Action Step:** Meditate on Matthew 7:24–27. Identify your current “storm.”

**Prayer:**
Lord, make me unshakable because I stand on You.
