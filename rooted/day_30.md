# Rooted

**Title:** Keep Growing

**Scripture:** 2 Peter 3:18 – 'Grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.'

**Devotion:**
Roots never stop growing—and neither should you. You haven’t arrived. Keep learning. Keep leaning in. Keep becoming. Grace makes space for progress over perfection.

**Action Step:** Choose one new way to grow this week—Bible study, prayer, fasting.

**Prayer:**
Jesus, I’m not done growing. Stretch my roots in grace and truth.
