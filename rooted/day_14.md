# Rooted

**Title:** Rooted in Identity, Not Image

**Scripture:** 1 John 3:1 – 'See what great love the Father has lavished on us, that we should be called children of God!'

**Devotion:**
You are not your appearance, your performance, or your past. You are a child of God. When your roots are in identity, not image, the opinions of others lose their power.

**Action Step:** Say this aloud: “I am a child of God, fully loved, fully known.”

**Prayer:**
Father, anchor me in who I am in You—not in what I do or how I’m seen.
