# Rooted

**Title:** Planted by the Stream

**Scripture:** Psalm 1:3 – 'They are like a tree planted by streams of water, which yields its fruit in season.'

**Devotion:**
You weren’t meant to survive off surface rain. You were created to draw deep from the source—God’s Word. Like a tree near the water, your fruit comes in its time, not all at once. Stay planted. Stay nourished.

**Action Step:** Read Psalm 1 slowly. Reflect: Are you rooted or drifting?

**Prayer:**
Lord, root me in Your Word so I can thrive in every season.
