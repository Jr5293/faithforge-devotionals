**Title:** Confession Cleans the Roots

**Scripture:** 1 John 1:9 – 'If we confess our sins, he is faithful... to cleanse us.'

**Devotion:**
Hidden sin strangles growth. Confession is not shame—it’s healing. It uproots rot and restores intimacy with God. You weren’t meant to carry secret burdens.

**Action Step:** Confess something to God in prayer today—honestly, fully.

**Prayer:**
Father, cleanse me. I bring everything into Your light.
