# Rooted

**Title:** Rooted in Grace, Not Performance

**Scripture:** Ephesians 2:8-9 – 'It is by grace you have been saved... not by works.'

**Devotion:**
You’re not a project God is annoyed by—you’re a person He delights in. Your worth isn’t in your performance but His love. Root your identity in grace, not striving.

**Action Step:** Write down 3 truths about who you are *in Christ* today.

**Prayer:**
Jesus, I rest in Your grace, not in what I do.
