# Rooted

**Title:** Hold Fast to the Truth

**Scripture:** John 8:32 – 'Then you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.'

**Devotion:**
Lies enslave. Truth sets free. But truth must be *known*, not just quoted. Let God's Word be your compass—not your culture, not your feelings. Truth is a root system.

**Action Step:** Identify a lie you’ve believed. Replace it with Scripture.

**Prayer:**
Jesus, root me in Your truth. Let no lie take hold in me.
