# Rooted

**Title:** Let Your Roots Go Deep

**Scripture:** Colossians 2:7 – 'Let your roots grow down into him and let your lives be built on him.'

**Devotion:**
Surface faith won’t last in deep storms. Real growth goes beneath emotion, beyond convenience, and into deep commitment. When you're rooted in Christ, you don't get easily shaken.

**Action Step:** Ask yourself: What area of my life needs deeper roots in God’s truth?

**Prayer:**
Jesus, dig my roots deep. I want more than surface belief.
