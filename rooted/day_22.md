**Title:** When God Says Wait

**Scripture:** Psalm 27:14 – 'Wait for the Lord; be strong and take heart...'

**Devotion:**
Waiting isn’t punishment. It’s preparation. Roots grow in the waiting. It’s where trust is formed and maturity is built. God isn’t withholding—He’s shaping.

**Action Step:** What are you waiting on? Write a prayer of surrender for it today.

**Prayer:**
Lord, I’ll wait with hope. Shape me while I wait.
