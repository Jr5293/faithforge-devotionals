**Title:** Fruit Takes Time

**Scripture:** Galatians 5:22 – 'The fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace...'

**Devotion:**
Fruit doesn’t show up overnight. Patience. God is producing something good in you. Just because you don’t *see* it doesn’t mean it’s not happening. Keep cultivating.

**Action Step:** Choose one fruit of the Spirit and focus on practicing it today.

**Prayer:**
Holy Spirit, grow Your fruit in me, even if it takes time.
