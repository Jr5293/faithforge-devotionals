# Rooted

**Title:** Don't Rush the Roots

**Scripture:** Psalm 92:14 – 'They will still bear fruit in old age.'

**Devotion:**
Culture says fast. God says faithful. Deep roots take time. You’re not behind. You’re becoming. God isn’t just trying to grow fruit—He’s growing you. Wait well.

**Action Step:** Slow down today. Say no to one thing that’s rushing your rhythm.

**Prayer:**
Father, I trust Your timing. Grow me deep, not just wide.
