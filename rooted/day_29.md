**Title:** You Are Not Alone

**Scripture:** Psalm 46:1 – 'God is our refuge and strength, an ever-present help in trouble.'

**Devotion:**
Even when you feel isolated, you’re never alone. God is present. Always. Your feelings don’t cancel His nearness. Even now—He’s closer than your breath.

**Action Step:** Sit with this truth: “God is with me right now.” Say it. Believe it.

**Prayer:**
Lord, thank You for never leaving. Anchor me in Your presence.
