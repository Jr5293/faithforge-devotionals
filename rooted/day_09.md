**Title:** Water the Soil Daily

**Scripture:** Matthew 6:11 – 'Give us this day our daily bread.'

**Devotion:**
You need daily spiritual food. Yesterday’s prayer won’t sustain today’s pressure. Time with God isn’t a task—it’s water to your soul. Build rhythm, not routine.

**Action Step:** Block off 10 minutes today to spend with God—no distractions.

**Prayer:**
God, remind me I need You daily, not occasionally.
