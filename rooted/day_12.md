**Title:** Trust the Pruning

**Scripture:** John 15:2 – 'He cuts off every branch... and prunes the ones that bear fruit.'

**Devotion:**
Pruning feels like loss—but it's love. God cuts back what distracts you so you can bear more fruit. Growth often comes after subtraction. Don’t resist the pruning. Trust the Gardener.

**Action Step:** Ask God what He might be pruning in your life—and why.

**Prayer:**
Father, I trust You even when You remove things. Help me grow deeper, not just bigger.
