**Title:** Grace for the Growth

**Scripture:** Philippians 1:6 – 'He who began a good work in you will carry it on to completion.'

**Devotion:**
You’re not finished. And that’s okay. Spiritual growth is a process—not a sprint. God is patient, and He’s not in a hurry. He finishes what He starts. So give yourself grace while you grow.

**Action Step:** Thank God for one area of growth you’ve already seen—and trust Him for the rest.

**Prayer:**
God, thank You for Your patience. Keep shaping me in Your time.
