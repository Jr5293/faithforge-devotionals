**Title:** Set the Anchor Daily

**Scripture:** Hebrews 12:2 – 'Fix your eyes on Jesus, the author and perfecter of faith.'

**Devotion:**
The winds of life blow daily. So should your anchoring. Fix your eyes on Jesus each morning—not after the storm starts. Your direction tomorrow starts with focus today.

**Action Step:** Start your morning tomorrow in the Word—before anything else.

**Prayer:**
Jesus, be my focus. Help me set my anchor before the waves hit.
