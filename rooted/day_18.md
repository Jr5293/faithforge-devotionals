**Title:** Forgiveness Breaks the Ground

**Scripture:** Colossians 3:13 – 'Forgive as the Lord forgave you.'

**Devotion:**
Unforgiveness hardens the soil of your soul. It blocks the Spirit’s work. Forgiveness doesn’t excuse the wrong—it releases you from its grip. Don’t grow bitter—grow free.

**Action Step:** Who do you need to forgive today? Release them in prayer.

**Prayer:**
Lord, I forgive as You forgave me. Break up the hardened places in my heart.
