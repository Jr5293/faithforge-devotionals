**Title:** The Hidden Life

**Scripture:** Colossians 3:3 – 'Your life is now hidden with Christ in God.'

**Devotion:**
The world celebrates what’s seen. God values what’s hidden. Your strength isn’t proven on stages—it’s formed in solitude. The hidden life is a holy life. Grow where no one is watching.

**Action Step:** Do something spiritual today that no one else will see—just you and God.

**Prayer:**
Jesus, make me faithful in the unseen places. Let me be real in the quiet.
