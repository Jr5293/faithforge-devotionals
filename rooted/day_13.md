**Title:** Be Still and Know

**Scripture:** Psalm 46:10 – 'Be still, and know that I am God.'

**Devotion:**
Stillness is not laziness—it’s trust. The deepest roots grow in rest, not hustle. When you’re still before God, your soul hears His voice more clearly. Be still. Let God be God.

**Action Step:** Turn off everything. Sit in God’s presence for 5–10 minutes without multitasking.

**Prayer:**
God, I want to know You—not just know about You. Quiet my soul.
