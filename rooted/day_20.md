**Title:** Anchor in the Word

**Scripture:** Psalm 119:105 – 'Your word is a lamp to my feet and a light to my path.'

**Devotion:**
When the winds of life blow, the Word is your anchor. Don’t build your faith on feelings. Build it on scripture. His promises don’t change—even when circumstances do.

**Action Step:** Pick one verse to memorize this week. Speak it daily.

**Prayer:**
Lord, anchor me in Your Word. Make it my guide and my guard.
