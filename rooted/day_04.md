**Title:** When God Feels Silent

**Scripture:** Psalm 37:7 – 'Be still before the Lord and wait patiently for him.'

**Devotion:**
Silence isn’t absence. God speaks in whispers, not always in fire. When He seems quiet, He’s still working. Keep showing up in the silence. You grow deepest in the waiting.

**Action Step:** Sit in silent prayer for 5 minutes today. Just listen.

**Prayer:**
Lord, I trust You even when You’re silent. Help me wait well.
