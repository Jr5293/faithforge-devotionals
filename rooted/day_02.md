**Title:** Faith Over Feeling

**Scripture:** 2 Corinthians 5:7 – 'We walk by faith, not by sight.'

**Devotion:**
Faith isn't a feeling. Feelings fluctuate. Faith stands. You won't always *feel* close to God—but you're called to walk close regardless. Faith moves forward even when emotions lag behind.

**Action Step:** Name one area where your feelings have blocked your faith. Step forward in trust.

**Prayer:**
God, help me to trust You even when I can’t trace You.
