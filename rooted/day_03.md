# Rooted

**Title:** The Word Builds Roots

**Scripture:** Colossians 3:16 – 'Let the Word of Christ dwell in you richly...'

**Devotion:**
Roots don’t grow without nourishment. And your soul can’t grow without Scripture. The Word anchors your beliefs, directs your actions, and strengthens your soul. Don’t snack—feast on the Word.

**Action Step:** Read one chapter of the Gospels today. Highlight what stands out.

**Prayer:**
Jesus, help me to treasure and trust Your Word above all.
