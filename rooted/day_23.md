**Title:** God is Not in a Hurry

**Scripture:** 2 Peter 3:9 – 'The Lord is not slow in keeping his promise...'

**Devotion:**
In a rush to move forward, we miss the joy of where we are. God’s timing is never late, never early—always right. Slowness doesn’t mean absence. It means depth.

**Action Step:** Slow your pace today. Go on a walk with no phone. Just be with God.

**Prayer:**
God, help me move at Your pace, not mine.
