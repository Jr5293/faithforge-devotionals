# Rooted

**Title:** Stay Connected to the Vine

**Scripture:** John 15:5 – 'Apart from me, you can do nothing.'

**Devotion:**
Roots don’t produce fruit—connection does. Stay plugged in to Jesus. When you drift from the vine, life dries up. Your job is not to strive—it’s to stay. Stay near the source.

**Action Step:** Start your day tomorrow with 5 minutes in John 15. Don’t skip it.

**Prayer:**
Jesus, keep me connected to You. You are the source of everything good in me.
