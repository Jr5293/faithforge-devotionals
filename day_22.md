**Title:** He Calls You by Name

**Scripture:** Isaiah 43:1 – 'Do not fear, for I have redeemed you; I have called you by name; you are mine.'

**Devotion:**
You’re not a number or a label to God. You’re known—personally, deeply. He doesn’t just call the qualified; He qualifies the called. You are His. Fully His.

**Action Step:** Say your name aloud today and remind yourself who you belong to.

**Prayer:**
Father, You know my name and You call me Yours. Let that truth define me today.
