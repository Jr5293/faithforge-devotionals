**Title:** Held by His Hands

**Scripture:** Isaiah 41:10 – 'So do not fear, for I am with you... I will uphold you with my righteous right hand.'

**Devotion:**
You don’t have to hold it all together—because God holds you. His hands are steady, strong, and sure. He hasn’t dropped you yet, and He never will.

**Action Step:** Close your eyes and picture being held by God’s hand. Let His strength calm you.

**Prayer:**
Father, thank You for holding me when I’m weak. I’m safe in Your hands.
