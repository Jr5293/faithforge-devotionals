**Title:** You’re Not Too Much

**Scripture:** Ephesians 2:10 – 'For we are God’s handiwork... prepared in advance for us to do.'

**Devotion:**
Your passion, presence, and personality are not 'too much'—they’re handcrafted. God doesn’t make extras or mistakes. You were designed with intention.

**Action Step:** Celebrate something about yourself today without apology.

**Prayer:**
Father, thank You that You made me on purpose and for a purpose.
