**Title:** Gentleness is Strength

**Scripture:** Proverbs 15:1 – 'A gentle answer turns away wrath...'

**Devotion:**
Gentleness is not weakness—it’s power under control. In a loud and reactive world, a gentle spirit is a testimony of grace. Jesus was bold *and* gentle. You can be both.

**Action Step:** Respond with gentleness today, especially when it’s hardest.

**Prayer:**
Jesus, give me a gentle spirit that reflects Your strength and love.
