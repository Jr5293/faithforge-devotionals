**Title:** Rooted in Purpose

**Scripture:** Romans 8:28 – 'And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him...'

**Devotion:**
Even the pieces that don’t make sense are part of God’s plan. He weaves your pain, your joy, and your waiting into purpose. You’re not wandering—you’re being woven.

**Action Step:** Write down one area of your life where you trust God is working—even if you can’t see it.

**Prayer:**
God, I trust that You’re turning all things for good. Give me eyes to see Your hand in it.
