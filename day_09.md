**Title:** Peace That Stays

**Scripture:** Isaiah 26:3 – 'You will keep in perfect peace those whose minds are steadfast...'

**Devotion:**
Peace isn’t the absence of problems—it’s the presence of God. When your mind is fixed on Him, peace becomes your default, not your reward. Stay focused. Stay grounded.

**Action Step:** When anxiety rises today, pause and repeat: 'God is with me. Peace is mine.'

**Prayer:**
Prince of Peace, guard my thoughts and steady my soul.
