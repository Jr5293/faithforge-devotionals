**Title:** Called, Not Compared

**Scripture:** Galatians 6:4 – 'Each one should test their own actions. Then they can take pride in themselves alone, without comparing themselves to someone else.'

**Devotion:**
Comparison chokes confidence. You weren’t called to copy—you were called to shine in your own lane. God’s purpose for you isn’t diminished by someone else’s. Stay focused. Stay faithful.

**Action Step:** Limit social media today. Spend time discovering *your* gifts instead.

**Prayer:**
Lord, free me from the trap of comparison. Remind me I am fearfully and wonderfully made—with a purpose only I can fulfill.
