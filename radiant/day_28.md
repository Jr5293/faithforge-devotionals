**Title:** You Were Made to Shine

**Scripture:** Matthew 5:14 – 'You are the light of the world...'

**Devotion:**
You were never meant to hide. God lit your life for a reason—to bring light where it’s dark. Don’t shrink back. Shine with love, truth, and courage. The world needs your light.

**Action Step:** Do something kind or courageous today that brings light to someone else.

**Prayer:**
Jesus, let my life shine with Your love and truth. Use me to brighten the dark.
