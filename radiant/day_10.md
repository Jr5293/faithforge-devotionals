**Title:** Bold in the Spirit

**Scripture:** 2 Timothy 1:7 – 'For God gave us a spirit not of fear but of power, love and self-control.'

**Devotion:**
You weren’t created to cower. You were born to be bold—not in arrogance, but in Spirit-filled confidence. Boldness is not volume. It’s conviction. Walk in it today.

**Action Step:** Take one bold step today that fear has been holding back.

**Prayer:**
Holy Spirit, make me courageous. Let my life echo Your power and love.
