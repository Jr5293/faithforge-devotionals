**Title:** Beauty from Within

**Scripture:** 1 Peter 3:4 – '...the unfading beauty of a gentle and quiet spirit, which is of great worth in God’s sight.'

**Devotion:**
Real beauty isn’t skin deep—it’s Spirit deep. The world looks at filters, but God looks at the heart. Cultivate kindness, peace, and strength in your spirit. That beauty never fades.

**Action Step:** Speak one word of encouragement to someone today—it beautifies the soul.

**Prayer:**
God, let my beauty come from Your Spirit in me, not the world around me.
