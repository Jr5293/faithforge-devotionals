**Title:** God Fights for You

**Scripture:** Exodus 14:14 – 'The Lord will fight for you; you need only to be still.'

**Devotion:**
You don’t always have to speak, move, or fix it. Sometimes faith means staying still while God moves. The battle isn’t always yours—but the victory is.

**Action Step:** Pause today in a conflict or challenge. Don’t react—pray first.

**Prayer:**
Lord, I trust You to fight for me. I will rest in Your strength today.
