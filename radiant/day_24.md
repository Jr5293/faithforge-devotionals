**Title:** Keep the Fire Lit

**Scripture:** 2 Timothy 1:6 – 'Fan into flame the gift of God, which is in you...'

**Devotion:**
The fire God placed in you is precious—but it needs tending. Life will try to smother it, but your job is to fan the flame. Stay close to the source. Stay burning.

**Action Step:** What spiritual habit needs rekindling? Start it again today.

**Prayer:**
Lord, reignite what’s grown cold. Let passion for You burn bright in me again.
