**Title:** Chosen and Cherished

**Scripture:** 1 Peter 2:9 – 'You are a chosen people, a royal priesthood... God’s special possession.'

**Devotion:**
You weren’t picked last—you were handpicked. Loved before you performed. Accepted before you proved yourself. You’re not just loved. You’re *wanted.*

**Action Step:** Write “I am chosen” somewhere visible today. Let it speak louder than doubt.

**Prayer:**
God, thank You that I am chosen and cherished. Help me live like I believe it.
