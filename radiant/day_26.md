**Title:** He Sees the Whole Story

**Scripture:** Ecclesiastes 3:11 – 'He has made everything beautiful in its time...'

**Devotion:**
God doesn’t just see your chapter—He sees your whole story. He knows how the pain becomes purpose, how the waiting produces wisdom. He makes *everything* beautiful—in His time.

**Action Step:** Pause and reflect on how God has used a past trial for good.

**Prayer:**
Lord, I trust You with the timeline. Write beauty into my story, even in the waiting.
