**Title:** He Holds Your Heart

**Scripture:** Psalm 34:18 – 'The Lord is close to the brokenhearted...'

**Devotion:**
God doesn’t avoid your pain—He enters it. When your heart breaks, He doesn’t back away—He draws near. He holds the shattered pieces and begins to rebuild with grace.

**Action Step:** Pray honestly about a place in your heart that still hurts.

**Prayer:**
Father, thank You for being near when I’m broken. Heal what I can’t fix on my own.
