**Title:** Clothed with Strength

**Scripture:** Proverbs 31:25 – 'She is clothed with strength and dignity; she can laugh at the days to come.'

**Devotion:**
God didn’t dress you in fear. He clothed you with strength. You are wrapped in dignity, equipped to face what’s ahead. When the future feels uncertain, remember what you’re wearing—His strength.

**Action Step:** Look in the mirror and declare: “I am clothed with strength.” Speak it out loud.

**Prayer:**
Lord, remind me that I don’t wear worry—I wear Your strength and dignity.
