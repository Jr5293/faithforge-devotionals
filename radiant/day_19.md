**Title:** Freedom is Yours

**Scripture:** Galatians 5:1 – 'It is for freedom that Christ has set us free...'

**Devotion:**
You weren’t saved to stay stuck. Christ’s freedom covers more than sin—it includes fear, guilt, and shame. Step out of the chains. You’re already free. Now walk like it.

**Action Step:** Identify one area where you’re living like you’re still bound. Speak freedom over it.

**Prayer:**
Jesus, thank You that I’m free. Teach me to walk in it boldly.
