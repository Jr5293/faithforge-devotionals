**Title:** Worthy of Rest

**Scripture:** Matthew 11:28 – 'Come to me, all who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest.'

**Devotion:**
You don’t have to earn rest—it’s your inheritance. In a world that glorifies hustle, Jesus invites you to breathe. You are not lazy for needing rest. You are human. And He is your rest.

**Action Step:** Schedule a moment of true rest today—no phone, no guilt. Just breathe.

**Prayer:**
Jesus, thank You that I don’t have to carry it all. Teach me to rest in You.
