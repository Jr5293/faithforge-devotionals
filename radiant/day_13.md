**Title:** Bloom Where You’re Planted

**Scripture:** Jeremiah 29:7 – 'Seek the peace and prosperity of the city... for if it prospers, you too will prosper.'

**Devotion:**
God can use your exact location, season, and situation. You don’t need perfect conditions to grow. Sometimes He’s not trying to move you—He’s trying to bloom you right where you are.

**Action Step:** Do one thing today to bless someone in your current environment.

**Prayer:**
Lord, help me grow right here. Use me where You’ve placed me.
