**Title:** Joy Is Your Strength

**Scripture:** Nehemiah 8:10 – '...the joy of the Lord is your strength.'

**Devotion:**
Joy isn’t optional—it’s essential. Not just a feeling, but a force that holds you up. Joy isn’t found in perfection but in presence—in knowing God is with you.

**Action Step:** List three things today that spark joy—and thank God for them.

**Prayer:**
Jesus, restore my joy. Make it my strength when I feel weak.
