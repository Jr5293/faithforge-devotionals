**Title:** Wisdom Is Beautiful

**Scripture:** Proverbs 3:15 – 'She is more precious than rubies; nothing you desire can compare with her.'

**Devotion:**
Wisdom isn’t loud, but it lasts. It adds beauty to your decisions, relationships, and character. True elegance starts in the mind and flows from the heart that listens to God.

**Action Step:** Ask God for wisdom in one decision you’re facing this week.

**Prayer:**
God, I want wisdom more than ease. Guide me with clarity and grace.
