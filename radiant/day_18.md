**Title:** Dignity in the Details

**Scripture:** Luke 12:7 – 'Even the hairs of your head are all numbered.'

**Devotion:**
God is not just powerful—He is personal. He pays attention to what others overlook. Your smallest need matters. You are not insignificant to the Infinite.

**Action Step:** Thank God today for a small detail in your life He has touched.

**Prayer:**
Lord, thank You for caring about the little things. You make me feel seen.
