**Title:** Faith That Stands

**Scripture:** 1 Corinthians 16:13 – 'Be on your guard; stand firm in the faith; be courageous; be strong.'

**Devotion:**
Faith isn’t just believing—it’s standing when everything tries to knock you over. True strength doesn’t mean you’re never shaken; it means you don’t fall when you are.

**Action Step:** Write down a moment when you stood firm in faith. Thank God for it.

**Prayer:**
Lord, strengthen my faith to stand—even when it’s hard, even when I’m tired.
